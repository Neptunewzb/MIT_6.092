# MIT 6.092 - Introduction to Programming in Java

## Overview
This repository contains my work for MIT's 6.092 course, "Introduction to Programming in Java." The course covers fundamental programming concepts using Java, including variables, conditional statements, loops, arrays, methods, classes, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Course Description
MIT 6.092 is designed to help students develop basic programming skills and learn to solve problems using Java. The course progressively builds from simple programs to more complex applications using object-oriented design.

## Repository Structure
- `/assignments` - Contains completed programming assignments
- `/projects` - Final project(s) developed during the course
- `/notes` - Personal notes and insights from lectures
- `/resources` - Additional learning materials and references

## Topics Covered
- Basic Java syntax and semantics
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if/else statements, loops)
